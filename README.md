# RUL prediction Study for Maintenance of Machinery Performance

Machinery like [Biomedical Recording Instruments](https://medium.com/@deepthiaj/unlocking-the-potential-of-biomedical-recording-instruments-addressing-challenges-b4acb3cd0b76) often are subject to wear-and-tear and hence this study on Remaining Useful Life (RUL) with NASA dataset on machines under the influence of even external factors influenced while in space can be an eye-opener to enhance the diagnosis accuracy by assisting maintenance using AI to ensure high precision of the biomedical instruments, especially in applications like telemedicine.
